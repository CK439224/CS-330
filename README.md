How do I approach designing and developing software? 
	
 My approach to designing software, I begin by analyzing the requirements set forth in the project
requirements. Once I review the requirements, I break down what needs to be completed into smaller
sections so I can develop code in smaller chunks. This allows me to test each section as I complete it.
These smaller chunks consist of the basic code for that section and I go back later and add more detail
to sections that require it. For example, when creating my cell phone, I started with just creating the
cube, ran the code to make sure a cube rendered. Then I moved the cube to the location that I wanted it,
once that was completed I added the texture. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
	
There are tons of things that I have learned throughout this term. I was quite intimidated at the beginning
of the term and struggled through a good portion. I would say the biggest thing that I learned to apply to
my project (but is not necessarily course related) is organization. In the beginning, my code was not that
organized which lead to issues when I tried to implement items as we learned them, I started putting things
in places they didn’t belong, forgetting to put things in, or was just overall confused because my structure
was different. It wasn’t until I re-did my code in a more structured way, it made it easier to implement these
new learned skills. If I would have been more organized from the beginning, I think I wouldn’t have struggled
so much throughout. Now for a course related thing I was able to learn and apply to my project. That would be
the implementation of mouse and keyboard commands to my code. I really haven’t had much experience with this
other than having the code read the string input. As of right now, my plan is to work more on the background
aspects of software development not related to creating graphics. Though, this class has opened my eyes to the
graphical side and peaked my interest.
