1.	How do I approach designing software?
	My approach to designing software, I begin by analyzing the requirements set forth in the project
	requirements. Once I review the requirements, I break down what needs to be completed into smaller
	sections so I can develop code in smaller chunks. This allows me to test each section as I complete it.
	These smaller chunks consist of the basic code for that section and I go back later and add more detail
	to sections that require it. For example, when creating my cell phone, I started with just creating the
	cube, ran the code to make sure a cube rendered. Then I moved the cube to the location that I wanted it,
	once that was completed I added the texture.
